# CPU player candidate

`eqoxide-headless` connects through the ordinary RoF2 login, world, character creation and zone
protocol. It runs the same physical controller as the graphical application on a 20ms CPU clock.
It loads native EQEmu `.map` v2 and `.wtr` v1/v2 files; it needs no display, GPU, textures, display
models, asset service or game string/spell files. Upstream source baseline is
`4bf520f2151976177a757428628995b33a3a3ee9`; the preparation appendix and check script are retained.

This is a candidate for staging qualification. Build and synthetic tests do not prove live play.
The authoritative selection and live results belong to the Operations project; this file documents
the executable and wire format.

## Build and launch

Run `scripts/build-headless` from this checkout. Its pinned Rust container uses the existing
locked dependency cache; `--online` permits missing dependencies to download. The output prints
`HEADLESS_BINARY=...`. Native Rust builds can use `cargo build -p eqoxide-headless --locked` after
disabling this repository's optional sccache/mold configuration if those tools are unavailable.
`scripts/check-headless-crates` runs the CPU tests without connecting a player.

Launch `eqoxide-headless --profile /absolute/private-profile.json`. The profile must be a regular
file with no group/other permissions, at most 64KiB. Invalid JSON errors never echo its contents.
Keep the real account password and control token outside this repository. The required JSON shape:

```json
{
  "login": {
    "login_host": "192.168.1.230", "login_port": 5999, "world_port": 9000,
    "username": "eqoxidepoc", "password": "PRIVATE",
    "character_name": "Eqoxidepoc",
    "character_create": {
      "race": 1, "class": 7, "gender": 0, "deity": 396, "start_zone": 2,
      "str": 80, "sta": 80, "agi": 105, "dex": 85, "wis": 75, "int": 75, "cha": 75
    }
  },
  "expected_world": { "name": "Bump Staging", "host": "192.168.1.220" },
  "api_port": 18765,
  "control_token": "PRIVATE-GENERATED-TOKEN-AT-LEAST-32-CHARACTERS",
  "maps_dir": "/private/native-maps"
}
```

`character_create` is optional if the named character exists. When absent, creation is refused;
when present, ordinary server name/combination/stat validation still applies. Cosmetics `face`,
`hairstyle`, `haircolor`, `beard`, `beardcolor`, `eyecolor1`, `eyecolor2` default to zero.
The example is the selected ordinary human monk combination on staging, not a general creation preset.

The listener binds exactly the specified loopback port before login. Port conflicts abort before
connecting. World selection requires exactly one advertised entry matching **both** name and host.
Login is attempted once; a failure remains readable through the API. No first-world fallback runs.
SIGINT/SIGTERM request normal logout. `camp` starts the ordinary approximately 30-second camp,
then normal logout and process exit; neither operation force-saves or edits the account externally.
A failed session remains observable until the process is signalled.

## HTTP control

Every route requires `Authorization: Bearer <control_token>`. There are no legacy mutation routes.
Read `GET /v2/player/state` first. Use its exact `session` and `zone_epoch` in each request:

```http
PUT /v2/player/commands/walk-1
Authorization: Bearer PRIVATE
Content-Type: application/json

{"session":"FROM-STATE","zone_epoch":1,"operation":{"kind":"move_for","east":1,"north":0,"duration_ms":300}}
```

Query `GET /v2/player/commands/walk-1`; repeat the identical PUT after losing a response.
An identical retry returns the retained result and never renews movement. A changed payload under
the same ID conflicts. IDs remain retained for the process lifetime; the journal rejects new work
at capacity, with one additional reserved identity each for `stop` and `attack_off`.
Do not retry an uncertain transaction under a new ID.

The CPU owner expires movement after 1–2000ms and attack after a 1–5000ms lease independently of
caller silence. A new `attack` command renews the lease. Movement uses the shared 35 units/sec
intent and real collision; a local result does not prove the server accepted the resulting position.
Stop, attack-off, death, connection loss, shutdown and a new zone entry stop applicable control.
`stop` stops movement; use `attack_off` separately to stop attacking.

| Operation kind | Fields / limits |
| --- | --- |
| `move_for` | `east`, `north` in [-1,1], `duration_ms` 1–2000; normalized direction, stand first |
| `stop` | none; priority movement stop |
| `target` | `entity_id` from the current received roster |
| `attack` | `lease_ms` 1–5000; live received NPC target within 30 units |
| `attack_off` | none; priority attack stop |
| `loot` | `entity_id` of a received dead NPC within 20 units; ordinary loot protocol |
| `sit`, `stand` | none; sit stops movement and attack |
| `say` | `text`, maximum 512 bytes |
| `tell` | `recipient`, `text` |
| `merchant_open` | `entity_id`, received within 30 units |
| `merchant_close` | none |
| `buy` | catalog `slot`, `quantity:1`; request also needs current `inventory_revision`, `merchant_revision` |
| `sell` | inventory `slot`, positive `quantity`; both revision fields required |
| `inventory_move` | `from_slot`, `to_slot` 0–32, `quantity:1`; inventory revision required |
| `camp` | none; ordinary camp and process shutdown |

Receipts distinguish `accepted`, `sent`, `applied_local`, `confirmed`, `refused`, `unknown`.
This host leaves queued network work accepted until an actual drain outcome or correlated reply;
it does not manufacture a send receipt. Buy and merchant-open confirmation comes from the real
server echo. Most other network commands can report `unknown` after dispatch because the protocol
provides no correlated receipt. Local attack toggles do not prove landed melee; local chat echoes
do not prove delivery. Sell/inventory writes block further transactions until a fresh process;
an ambiguous buy does too. Use normal camp/save/relog to reconcile. This process provides no
exactly-once guarantee across a crash.

State contains one published revision, native geometry digest, network tick/inbound/link ages,
predicted feet position, vitals, inventory and catalog revisions. The roster is received knowledge
within 500 units, sorted by spawn ID and capped at 256. `complete:false` discloses that it is not
an authoritative world roster; truncation is separate. LOS is a local static native-map query.
Unknown instance ID is null. Inventory includes local prediction and does not prove a save.

`GET /v2/player/events?after=SESSION:CURSOR&wait=5` long-polls for at most 5 seconds. Use the
state's `event_cursor` verbatim. Gaps are explicit; reread state and outstanding commands after one.
Received chat (including NPC say) carries packet provenance; other game events are labeled client events.
Outbound local messages are not receipt evidence. `received_self_echo` records a server-returned
self message with channel/sender/text and `recipient_delivery_confirmed:false`; it does not confirm
delivery to another player. Legacy self-echo filtering remains unchanged. Received spawn class is exposed as nullable `class_id`.
Automatic corpse looting and automatic zone-line requests are disabled for CPU sessions.
Only explicit `loot` requests begin looting, including for the character's own kills.

## Limits

Initial qualification covers one dry Qeynos2 route. Dynamic doors, native climb metadata,
automatic route planning/zoning, spells, P2P trade, corpse retrieval and graphical visibility are
outside this POC. Native map v1 is rejected. Missing or invalid collision prevents movement/readiness;
water-data failure is disclosed independently. Geometry uses bounded decompression, model/placement
expansion and grid construction. The runtime never accepts privileged observer facts as perception.
